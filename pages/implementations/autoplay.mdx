# __Autoplay__

Autoplay is a feature that allows you to automatically play songs related to the one you are currently listening to.

<Callout type="info">
We are the first to have autoplay for Spotify, SoundCloud, and, as usual, YouTube. and we are adding support for other platforms.
</Callout>

# __How to use__

To use this feature, you don't need to enable or disable anything, just put this in your **queueEnd** event and you're done. (already implemented in the example.)

```js copy showLineNumbers {7}
client.riffy.on("queueEnd", async (player) => {
    const channel = client.channels.cache.get(player.textChannel);
    
	const autoplay = false;

    if (autoplay) {
        player.autoplay(player)
    } else {
        player.destroy();
        channel.send("Queue has ended.");
    }
})
```

# __How it works__

The autoplay feature works by searching for songs related to the one you are currently listening to, and then adding them to the queue.

The autoplay feature is not perfect, so it may not always work as expected.
